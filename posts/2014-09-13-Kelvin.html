<p>The ether needed to be very rigid for fast motions, while at the same time not impede slow motions. Cobbler’s wax, a material that behaves as solid for fast motion (it will shatter when hit with a hammer) but as liquid for slow motion (it will slowly flow down the glacier.) I was furter impressed when I recognized a nozzle crafted at the midpoint of the ladders. I can read Kelvin’s intention of studying the equations of motion of the matter.</p>
