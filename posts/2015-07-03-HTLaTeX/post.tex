\title{Using \LaTeX~with Hakyll}
\author{Takayuki Muranushi}

\begin{document}

\maketitle

This HTML is generated from \LaTeX~source via {\tt latex2html}
and then embedded into Hakyll-hosted blog. The use of LaTeX will allow us the use of
complex expressions e.g. $G_{\mu,\nu}=\frac{8\pi G}{c^4}T_{\mu,\nu}$ and

\begin{eqnarray}
\frac{\partial{\vec v}}{\partial t} &=& \vec \nabla s
\end{eqnarray}

This attempt seems to basically working although there are few
glitches (like the duplicated title you can see.) Fixing these should be some
cumbersome script work but should not be too hard.



I am further trying to use this technology in combination with Haskell
DSLs such as
\hyperlink{http://hackage.haskell.org/package/authoring}{authoring}
and units \cite{muranushi2014experience} , to write
physical discussions in Haskell and LaTeX.
