Today, I've learned from [one of my friend](https://twitter.com/dif_engine)
about a new development in mathematics called synthetic differential geometry. He pointed us to 
[an introductory paper](http://arxiv.org/abs/0805.3307).

The synthetic differential geometry allows us to deal with
differentiations and infinitesimal quantities in an intuitional
way. It is different from, but have similarity to, nonstandard
analysis.

It may be useful in e.g. constucting new discretization schemes. I'll look at it again.
