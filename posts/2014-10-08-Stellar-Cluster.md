Stellar cluster are gravitationally-bound group of stars.


Open Cluster
-----------

Open clusters are formed out of molecular cloud. Each open cluster
consists of stars that are born from the same molecular cloud.

Open clusters are only found near galactic equatorial planes.
Recent observations such as those by
Pfalzner (2009), (2011)

| Item                     | Age       | Mass   |
| ------------------------ | ---------:| ------:|
| Traditional Open cluster |      10Myr|  10Msun|
| Embedded cluster 	   |      10Myr|  10Msun|
| Young massive cluster	   |      10Myr|  10Msun|
| Leaky cluster            |      10Myr|  10Msun|


Globular Cluster 
------------- 

Globular clusters are formed in the process of galaxy formation. In
other words, globular clusters are smaller siblings of galaxies. 

Globular clusters have spherically symmetric distribution about galactic gravitational center.
