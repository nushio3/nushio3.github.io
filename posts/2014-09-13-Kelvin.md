I am never content until I have constructed a mechanical model of the subject I am studying. If I succeed in making one, I understand. Otherwise, I do not.

The ether needed to be very rigid for fast motions, while at the same
time not impede slow motions.  Cobbler's wax, a material that behaves
as solid for fast motion (it will shatter when hit with a hammer) but
as liquid for slow motion (it will slowly flow down the glacier.)  I
was furter impressed when I recognized a nozzle crafted at the
midpoint of the ladders. I can read Kelvin's intention of studying the
equations of motion of the matter.




He introduced brand new scientific apparatus and led teaching by example and demonstration.

The life and soul of science is its practical application.

There is nothing new to be discovered in physics now. All that remains is more and precise measurement.

To live among friends is the primary essential of happiness.

I hope to continue a student of the University as long as I live.
