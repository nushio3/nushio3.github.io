Today I've learnt from On today's seminar that the global simulation
of planet system formation is yet to be done.  The planet formation
path differs, in different regions of protoplanetary system.  The
different regions include rocky-planets region, gas giants region and
icy-planets region.  They have different evolution path. The formation
of these planets may interact with others.  For example, rapid growth
of gas giants may purturb planetesimal orbits. This will affect growth
of rocky planets, or how much comets enter rocky planet regions.
That, would determine how much water we have on Earth.

The recent advance on integration scheme [Nitadori+
2006](http://arxiv.org/abs/astro-ph/0511062) as well as on hadware are
making such dare simulations near possible.

By the way I have also heard that Aarseth spent 3 years, continuing one
simulations. The machine was switched over 3 generations. Amazing and
resilient feat it is.
