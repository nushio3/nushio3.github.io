[A new, mesh-free hydrodynamic solver](http://arxiv.org/abs/1409.7395) has been invented and published
by [Philip Hopkins](http://www.tapir.caltech.edu/~phopkins/Site/Welcome.html).

I have always wondered why all the suffering of discretized partial differential equation is coming from.
I feel like weakforms is the key. I have surveyed e.g.
[G-space theory](https://www.google.co.jp/search?q=g+space+theory) by G.R. Liu.
Can we design weakform solvers e.g. so that Riemann solvers are automatically deduced? I have yet
to learn.
